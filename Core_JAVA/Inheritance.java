Inheritance in Java
Inheritance is one of the four pillars of OOP. It allows a class (child/subclass) to reuse the fields and methods 
of another class (parent/superclass), which helps in code reusability and reduces redundancy.

In Java, we achieve inheritance using the <extends> keyword.

Single-level inheritance â†’ One parent class and one child class.
Multi-level inheritance â†’ A chain of inheritance, e.g., Class A â†’ Class B â†’ Class C.

Java does not support multiple inheritance (a class having more than one direct parent) to avoid the 
diamond problem.
For example:
    - If Class C inherits from both Class A and Class B, and both A and B have a method with the same 
     name, C wonâ€™t know which one to use â€” this creates ambiguity.
    - To solve this, Java allows multiple inheritance only through interfaces, not through classes.

ðŸ’¡ One-liner for interviews:
Inheritance lets a child class reuse the code of a parent class using extends. Java supports single and 
multi-level inheritance but avoids multiple inheritance with classes to prevent ambiguity (diamond problem).
